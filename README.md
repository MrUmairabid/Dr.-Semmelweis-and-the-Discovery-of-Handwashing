# Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing
This notebook analyzes the data that led Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis to discover the importance of handwashing in preventing childbed fever in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital.

Introduction
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician born in 1818 who was active at the Vienna General Hospital in the early 1840s. At that time, as many as 10% of the women giving birth at the hospital died from childbed fever. Dr. Semmelweis discovered that the cause of the disease was the contaminated hands of doctors delivering the babies, but his colleagues did not believe him and did not wash their hands.

Objective
The objective of this notebook is to reanalyze the data that Dr. Semmelweis used to make his discovery and gain insights into the importance of handwashing in preventing the spread of infections.

Data
The data used in this notebook is from two sources:

Monthly number of deaths from childbed fever at the Vienna General Hospital from 1841 to 1849
Monthly number of births at the Vienna General Hospital from 1841 to 1849
Analysis
The notebook includes the following analyses:

The proportion of deaths among births in the maternity clinic in 1841 and 1842
The effect of handwashing on the proportion of deaths among births in the maternity clinic in 1847
The effect of handwashing on the proportion of deaths among births in the maternity clinic in 1848
Conclusion
The analysis shows that handwashing is an effective way to prevent the spread of infections and that it was a crucial factor in reducing the mortality rate of childbed fever at the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s. This discovery by Dr. Semmelweis was a major breakthrough in the field of medicine and has saved countless lives since then.
